This is a cool website I made that lets you bring down differen't gifs, dealing mostly with cars, or car names.
When you type in the car name or brand, you'll get back 10 gifs, and you can play or pause them.

When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
